### Welcome!

This is our Group Project for the course "Programming - Introduction Level" at the University of St.Gallen by Mario Silic. 
With our code "main.py" it is possible, to discover the New York Times Bestseller list from 1942 to 2013.The code does (1) **import and clean the text file** (you'll also find in the folder), (2) **create functions**, to e.g. look up a certain author or title, or plot the top publishers in a certain period of time, and (3) **initiate a simple User-Interface** which let the user decide, what happens. 
The code is from a diverse and multicultural team, thus different techniques where applied, e.g. to filter data. This should on the one hand show, that we have been experimenting with different approaches and - as often in the real word - there's more than one way to skin a cat. On the other hand, e.g. different output formats, should provide the user with great possibilities to choose his or hers individually prefered style. 

###### Feel try the code on our repl.it:

Have fun with the code and best wishes!
