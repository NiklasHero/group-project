# Welcome!

This is our Group Project for the course "Programming - Introduction Level" at University of St.Gallen by Mario Silic. 
With our code "main.py" it is possible, to discover the New York Times Bestseller list from 1942 to 2013.The code does (1) import and clean the text file (you'll also find in the folder), (2) create functions, to e.g. look up a certain author or title, or plot the top publishers in a certain period of time, and (3) there is a simple User-Interface which let the User decide, what happens. 

Feel free to start the code on our repl.it:

Best Thanks!
Silvan, Stefanie, Jonas, Anette and Niklas
